Command Line
============

There is an exposed command line interface that is available upon
installation of the repository.  It can be run with ``orcoursetrion``, and
``orcoursetrion --help`` will provide the most up to date help information.

The command allows you to run commands that correspond to actions,
currently the only supported action is ``create_export_repo``, and if
your environment is setup correctly and you run ``orcoursetrion
create_export_repo -t Spring_2030 -c DevOps.001 -d 'My awesome class
repo'`` you should see it respond with the URL of the repo that it
just created for you.
